Find the Missing Number


Given an array arr[] of size n-1 with distinct integers in the range of [1, n].
This array represents a permutation of the integers from 1 to n with one element missing.
Find the missing element in the array.

Examples:
Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 4, 6, 3, 7, 8] 
Output: 5
Explanation: Here the size of the array is 7, so the range will be [1, 8]. The missing number between 1 to 8 is 5


Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Here the size of the array is 4, so the range will be [1, 5]. The missing number between 1 to 5 is 4
