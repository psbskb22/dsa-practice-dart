Maximum Subarray Sum – Kadane’s Algorithm


Given an array arr[], the task is to find the subarray that has the maximum sum and return its sum.

Examples: 
Input: arr[] = {2, 3, -8, 7, -1, 2, 3}
Output: 11
Explanation: The subarray {7, -1, 2, 3} has the largest sum 11.


Input: arr[] = {-2, -4}
Output: –2
Explanation: The subarray {-2} has the largest sum -2.


Input: arr[] = {5, 4, 1, 7, 8}
Output: 25
Explanation: The subarray {5, 4, 1, 7, 8} has the largest sum 25.
